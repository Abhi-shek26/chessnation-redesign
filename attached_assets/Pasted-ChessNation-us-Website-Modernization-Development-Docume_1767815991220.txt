4A. Global Sponsored Teams & Global Championship Platform (NEW CORE INITIATIVE)
Vision
ChessNation is building a global, sponsor-driven junior team ecosystem, where independently sponsored national teams compete through a structured pathway toward an annual Global Championship Finale.
These are NOT ChessNation-owned teams. ChessNation serves as the platform, organizer, and endowment builder, similar to how modern esports ecosystems operate.
This model mirrors professional esports team structures such as Team Falcons, Team Liquid, NAVI, Gen.G, Team Secret, Team Vitality, and others—adapted specifically for elite scholastic chess.
